\title{Map Manufacturer identifiers to Accession Numbers}  
\description{ 
  primeviewACCNUM is an R object that contains mappings between a
  manufacturer's identifiers and manufacturers accessions.
}
\details{
  For chip packages such as this, the ACCNUM mapping comes directly from the
  manufacturer.  This is different from other mappings which are mapped onto
  the probes via an Entrez Gene identifier.

  Each manufacturer identifier maps to a vector containing a GenBank accession
  number.

  Mappings were based on data provided by: Entrez Gene  
  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA  
  With a date stamp from the source of: 2020-Sep23

## select() interface:
## Objects in this package can be accessed using the select() interface
## from the AnnotationDbi package. See ?select for details.

## Bimap interface:
x <- primeviewACCNUM
# Get the probe identifiers that are mapped to an ACCNUM
mapped_probes <- mappedkeys(x)
# Convert to a list
xx <- as.list(x[mapped_probes])
if(length(xx) > 0) {
  # Get the ACCNUM for the first five probes
  xx[1:5]
  # Get the first one
  xx[[1]]
